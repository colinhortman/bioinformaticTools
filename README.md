# bioinformaticTools
This is a collection of tools that I created during my time at UCSC.  Many tools were assignments so they will not be listed on this page.  For this folder, the two places I wrote the programs for are: final project for class BME160 (Programming for Biology: Python) and Nader Pourmand lab.  There is no research data attached to the files or samples. The are occasionally test files attached but have been made very small or changed in significant ways as to not give away research.  I hope you find these tools helpful, although they are probably for niche tests and research. Enjoy!


## annotateVcfFromNCBI.py
 This is a class that will take in a variant isec file and return annotations based on reference genes.
 isec is a BCFtool that can be found here: https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools-man.html#isec
# The goal of this program is to help identify the proteins that are common among several samples.
  Use a redirect of standard out to create a text file.  This file will be used by countVariances.py
Example $py annotateVcfWithNCBI.py >annotationSample1.txt
###  Warning: 
This program is memory intensive and may require you to split the annotation text file from NCBI.  My tests could only handle around 200,000 lines.  A good solution to this is parsing through the file in a different way.  For my purpose (one species), this was fine.  If you need to do this on many species, it may require some reworking.

## countVariances.py
The purpose of variCount is to count the products that are reported from annotateVcfWithNCBI.py
 Input: File created by annotateVcfWithNCBI.py
 Output: Counts of mutated proteins.
 Note: I hope this set of programs are useful to you, or can be easily modified to do so. Additionally, this program was not built with the intention of being robust, but was a quick script.  I will edit it if I use it again.
 Future directions: Commandline inFiles,
